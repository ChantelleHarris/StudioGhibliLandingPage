This is a Udacity assignment that requires using JavaScript to make a page dynamic. With this  project, I will learn how to determine if an element is in the viewport, add and remove classes  
from an element, and, among other things, create smooth scrolling behavior using JavaScript.  

I chose to make my page about Studio Ghibli because it lives in a special place in my heart.

For this project, I rely heavily on the notes I've taken from the course material and Google.
