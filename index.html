                <h4>The Long Wait & Journey to Hayao Miyazaki</h4>
                <p>Impactful. Visually Stunning. Imaginative.<br>
                    The worlds and stories of Studio Ghibli are these and more as they reveal to us our hearts. 
                    We all know and love the wonderful productions that come from Studio Ghibli and that
                    the main man, founder Hayao Miyazaki, needs no introduction. I even made a cute website
                    using the Studio Ghibli API that displays information about the characters, places, and
                    vehicles of Studio Ghibli. You can find and enjoy that 
                    <a href="https://chantelleharris.github.io/Studio_Ghibli_API/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    Along with the impact of thestories that I cherish here, I have my own story to tell--
                    the story of how my love for the craft, the spirit, and the mind of Hayao Miyazaki began.
                    <br><br>
                    It began when I was unaware of anything, when I was a child in the 90s. All I
                    remember is that I saw a large wolf's head moving by itself to eat someone. Sound familiar?
                    Yes, that was Princess Mononoke, but it wouldn't be until last year that I finally found
                    that movie again. For many years, it would remain nameless, and I would yearn to see it again.
                    When I found it last year, I was browsing through HBO Max, and I saw a thumbnail with a girl
                    standing next to a large wolf. Instantly, my memory played back to me, and I knew I had to 
                    watch this movie. I was drawn to it, and indeed my intuition was correct. This was the movie
                    I had long been searching for! So began again my journey through the worlds of Studio Ghibli.
                    The magic of these films is one that help us understand our own nature and our relationships 
                    with others, ourselves, and the seen and unseen worlds around us. Next, I'll talk about my 
                    top two favorite movies: "Howl's Moving Castle" and "Spirited Away."

                    Ponyo and Princess Mononoke were seen as a child, and nearly forgotten. I remembered a
                    moving wolf head, and for many years, I had wanted to know the name of this lost movie.
