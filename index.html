            <h3>The Legacy of Hayao Miyazaki</h3>
            <p>Ponyo and Princess Mononoke were seen as a child, and nearly forgotten. I remembered a
                moving wolf head, and for many years, I had wanted to know the name of this lost movie.
                When I saw the image of Princess Mononoke with the Goddess Wolf, I knew I had to watch 
                this movie. I was drawn to it, and, indeed, my intuition was correct. This was the movie
                I had long been searching for! So began again my journey through the worlds of Studio Ghibli.
                These films are, in two words, imaginative and magical, and so much more. They help us
                understand our own nature and our relationships with others, ourselves, and the seen and 
                unseen worlds around us.
                Next, I'll talk about my top two favorite movies: Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away.
