                <h4>The Long Wait & Journey to Hayao Miyazaki</h4>
                <p>Impactful. Visually Stunning. Imaginative.<br>
                    The worlds and stories of Studio Ghibli are these and more as they reveal to us our hearts. 
                    We all know and love the wonderful productions that come from Studio Ghibli and that
                    the main man, founder Hayao Miyazaki, needs no introduction. I even made a cute website
                    using the Studio Ghibli API that displays information about the characters, places, and
                    vehicles of Studio Ghibli. You can find and enjoy that 
                    <a href="https://chantelleharris.github.io/Studio_Ghibli_API/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    Along with the impact of thestories that I cherish here, I have my own story to tell--
                    the story of how my love for the craft, the spirit, and the mind of Hayao Miyazaki began.
                    <br><br>
                    It began when I was unaware of anything, when I was a child in the 90s. All I
                    remember is that I saw a large wolf's head moving by itself to eat someone. Sound familiar?
                    Yes, that was Princess Mononoke, but it wouldn't be until last year that I finally found
                    that movie again. For many years, it would remain nameless, and I would yearn to see it.
                    When I found it last year, I was browsing through HBO Max, and I saw a thumbnail with a girl
                    standing next to a large wolf. Instantly, my memory played back to me, and I knew I had to 
                    watch this movie. I was drawn to it, and indeed my intuition was correct. This was the movie
                    I had long been searching for! So began again my journey through the worlds of Studio Ghibli.
                    The magic of these films is one that help us understand our own nature and our relationships 
                    with others, ourselves, and the seen and unseen worlds around us. Next, I'll talk about my 
                    top two favorite movies: "Howl's Moving Castle" and "Spirited Away."

                <hr class="light-line">
                <h4>A Tale of Courage & the Quest for Freedom</h4>
                
                <p>
                    Howl's Moving Castle was the first movie I'd watched after re-discovering Princess Mononoke
                    and Studio Ghibli. It is simply stunning, and I was instantly enamored and enchanted by Howl himself,
                    Calcifer, and the Castle.
                    <br><br>
                    Heartless Howl isn't heartless after all, for his heart dwells within and is manifested in the mighty,
                    sweet, and child-like Calcifer. He is never too far away. Howl is a handsome, young, and mild-tempered
                    wizard equipped with a soothing voice reminiscent of wisdom. He's fashionable and seemingly 
                    balanced in his masculine and feminine energies. He's a bit vain and intitially harbored internal fears, 
                    but with the love of a woman, he conquered that, and I don't even consider those to be flaws. I haven't 
                    known a more perfect character to love.
                    <br><br>
                    Howls' castle is just as much an extention of him as Calcifer is. Of, course, it did need a woman's
                    touch (wink). From it's interior and exterior design, it's portals, and it's ability to physically
                    move, I was taken away with the dream of being able to live anywhere and visit many places without 
                    the burden of money and moving. No rent. No travel expenses. What a thought! And when Howl was made
                    whole, the castle was able to fly. That is a wonder and a drop of sweetness to the imagination.
                    <br><br>
                    Then, there's Sophie. She's the one I truly resonated with. Yes, she's a woman like me, but that's not
                    what I'm referring to. I was inspired by the way she faced each obstacle with optimism, courage, and 
                    fearlessness. Naturally, she is the reason Howl found his courage. She wasted no time accepting her cursed
                    condition--embracing it, and that ultimately allowed her to grow into her power and truth. I want 
                    to be more like her. Hers is the way I want to move in, in love instead of fear. Besides, she gets to be 
                    loved by Howl and live in such a magical world. Who could ever ask for more?

                <h4>The Unseen & the Endurance of the Human Spirit</h4>
                <p>The spirit world is often portrayed as a terrifying place full of ghosts and demons. "Spirited Away"
                    beautifully does away with those negative ideas and gives life to the spirit world and those who dwell
                    in it. It's a place separated only by stone carvings and nightfall, not death. Its inhabitants have 
                    lives that do not consist of stealing or possessing the lives of those who dwell in the material world.
                    <br><br>
                    Chihiro is a brave child who touches the hearts of nearly everyone she encounters--an ability I both
                    admire and desire. She accomplishes this because she is genuine, loving, trustworthy, loyal, and 
                    honorable. Chirhiro finds herself in the spirit world on a quest to save her parents by remembering who
                    she is and choosing who she will be. This, I believe, is what this story is about.
                    <br><br>
                    The Sacred Name. Identity. Love.<br>
                    First, her parents were taken from her. Then, her name, her identity. Should she forget, all would be
                    lost for her and her parents. Love kept her going, and she did not allow the fear she experienced to
                    stifle her quest for freedom. Rather, she chose to fight for those she cares for, which began to include
                    a lost, protective River Spirit. Next, I'll talk about the films that are, for me, the most impactful: 
                    "Whisper of the Heart," "When Marnie was There," and "Only Yesterday."

                <h4>The Cultivation of the Passion of the Heart</h4>
                <p>After watching "Whisper of the Heart," I realized that the title couldn't have been more perfectly
                    chosen. Our passions constantly whisper at us, pushing us toward the making of our destinies.
                    <br><br>
                    As it happens, Shizuku's calling is to be a writer, an author, like me. This film is about the 
                    Whisper of MY Heart. Though, I do wish there was a loyal, caring, passionate Seiji Amasawa waiting
                    to take my hand in love and marriage. This Seiji Amasawa, a boy possessing wisdom beyond his years,
                    will grow into a man who is also a provider and protector of his Shizuku.
                    <br><br>
                    The magic of this story lies, not only in Shizuku's imagination, but also in its simplicity, 
                    authenticity, and in the early maturity of these two very innocent children who have chosen to follow
                    the whispers of their hearts, which include their life's callings and their budding passions for each 
                    other.

                <h4>Finding Yourself through Ancestral Discovery</h4>
                <p>I'm sure you can tell by now the reason why I've chose these as the most impactful Studio Ghibli films for me:
                    I deeply resonate with the main characters and what happens to them. My only wish is that my life reaches that
                    moment when everything is resolved and my "happily ever after" is allowed to play out without interruption.
                    <br><br>
                    Anna Sasaki is a quiet, angry child with no sense of identity and belonging. She's a socially awkward loner by
                    default, not by choice. Again, she is much like me. When Anna takes a vacation to a village that is, unbeknownst 
                    to her, near her ancestral home, the property calls out to her, starting a series of sometimes frightening events 
                    that ultimately and inevitably heal Anna of her unseen wounds and traumas. She is healed by befriending the 
                    childhood spirit of her late Grandmother, Marnie. What a blessing!
                    <br><br>
                    Anna, however, is doubly and triply blessed. You see, Anna, an orphan, was sent to live with her adoptive aunt 
                    and uncle by her adoptive mother, Yoriko. She sent her away for her health. These people loved her, and it is 
                    this love that allowed for Anna's healing to take place. Oh, to be surrounded by those who love and care about
                    your well-being--a magnificent blessing indeed.
